helper tools for conda environment

- [conda cheat-sheet](./conda.txt) - various solutions to conda usage

- [compare 2 conda envs](./conda-env-compare.md) - if you have something working in one conda environment, but not the other, it helps to be able to compare the differences between installed packages in each of them. This script does the job.
